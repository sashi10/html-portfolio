<hr>
<h3>1. Star Wars *****</h3>
<p>I love Star Wars. It has got everything i like. Outerspace, Alien planets, Aliens, Tech and Robots and so on. The Best of all is the character Anakin Skywalker and Darth Vader. Also Obi-wan kenobi and Hansolo.</p>
<h3>2.Prirates of Carrabian Sea ******</h3>
<p>I love this because of Johnny Deep and his character as Jack Sparrow. It the most intelligent character and the funniest. Everything about it is great. </p>
<h3>3. Alexander the Great *****</h3>
<p>It's because i love greek civilization and Alexander is the one who has inspired me the most when i was young. I derived my name Alex from Alexander. I used to break down his name like Alex-an-der.
    Everthing about this movie is great. The cast, the music, cinematography, everything is so perfect.
